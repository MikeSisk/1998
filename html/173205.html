<p><b>Tufa Towers</b>



<p><i>Mono Lake, California</i>



<p>This photo was taken at sunrise one very cold fall morning at the South Tufa Area along

the south shore of Mono Lake. The towers are made of calcium carbonate and are created when

calciumated fresh water from underwater springs combine with the carbonated salt water of

the main lake body.



<p>Normally these formations are underwater. They were exposed when the city of Los Angeles

started to divert the water from Mono Lake's feeder streams in 1941.
